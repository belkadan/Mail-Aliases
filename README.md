Apple Mail allows you to have multiple e-mail addresses associated with a single account by separating them with commas in the preferences. However, every e-mail address within an account will have the same display name, what Mail calls "Full Name" in the account settings.

As it turns out, [Mail supports this][EmailAliases]. It just doesn't have a way to set this from its own preferences anymore.

Enter **Mail Aliases**. This thrown-together app allows you to quickly and easily add aliases to any of your existing accounts, which will show up alongside your normal account e-mails in Mail when you go to compose a new message. Try it!

_Usual disclaimer applies: using Mail Aliases may cause all your e-mail settings to be lost, your computer to crash, and your firstborn to develop an obsession with erhu music. However, from knowledge of how these things usually work, I'm 93% sure that once you have_ finished _using Mail Aliases, leaving the aliases in place shouldn't break anything even for future updates of Mail._
